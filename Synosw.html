                <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                <p>
                    Story Synopsis, also referred to as the first treatment of Star Wars, was the first step in the creation of the script for Episode IV. 
                    George Lucas wrote it in the spring of 1973 and gave it to 
                    United Artists for perusal on May 7, 1973. It was rejected on May 29, 1973, 
                    because of the projected budget of $3 million. It was then sent to Universal, 
                    which failed to make a decision in the ten days allotted. On July 13, the picture was
                    offered to Twentieth Century Fox. They accepted, and moved forward 
                    (with an option to withdraw at any time) with Lucas to write a screenplay. 
                    One year after the completion of the treatment, in May 1974, The Star Wars: 
                    Rough Draft was finished.
